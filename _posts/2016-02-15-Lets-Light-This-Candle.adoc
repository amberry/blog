I am in no way as cool as Alan Shephard, nor am I sitting atop a rocket, but its
my standard call for forging on, and getting started, and so it seemed fitting to yell it here,
at the dawn of the blog.

The day job has me working on delivering big data as infrastructure. More specifically we
provide Hadoop and the stack, deliver a bunch of related infrastructure and systems to do that,
and use Chef and Ruby for config management and automation.

I'm technical lead for a team with the grandiose name of Engineering Productivity, formally we
provide the tools, infrastructure and support so that all of our teams (dev teams and pure ops
teams included) can fly.

Its hard. And I really enjoy that.

Whats hard about it?
--------------------

Distributed systems are a hard class of things all on their lonesome. Config management is no
cake walk either. Config management and orchestration of distributed systems is really quite difficult.

There are a fairly large array of languages and build tools that go into these systems,
and herding all of those, and supporting our small dev teams with them is an effort. Change
management combining open source projects, internal application code and Chef cookbooks is
enough to keep you up at night, and yes, config code should be treated like all other, tested, 
versioned and delivered.

So, whats the walk?
-------------------

Do the simplest thing that works.

Working on all of this together brings plenty of complexity to the table, so everything else
done around it should be as simple as possible.

But notice I didn't say easiest. Rich Hickey (a personal hero) had that exactly right. Any
attempt I've seen going after the easy route, has resulted in trouble. Build Simple.

That bakes in to dev choices, bringing in new components into the stack, and how you setup your
pipelines and automation.

And the talk...?
----------------

We'll look at the devops holy trinity; tools, process, culture. Attempting to stay away from
rants, tempering both the highs and the lows.

Thats it for now, more to come, hope the rocket works ;)
